# CSS Processor Examples

Here you can find some working examples of the Media Query Extensions.

Please note that to execute the media queries server side, the css must be pulled through the wew.io service. A demo is provided, but we recommend to sign up for an account at [whateverweb.com](http://whateverweb.com) to get the most out of it.

For a list of all device capabilities available as media features, see official [WURFL doc](http://scientiamobile.com/wurflCapability/tree). In addition to this, your custom capabilities are available, of course.

Please see the [CSS Optimizer docs](http://docs.whateverweb.com/documentation/imports/) for more information.
